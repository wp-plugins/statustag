== Description ==

"StatusTag" enables you to put your site's tagline to better use. Instead of having a static block of predefined text being displayed, StatusTag will enable you to fetch your latest tweet from Twitter, and display that instead! This facilitates a much more interesting and personal user of the tagline space.

StatusTag has a few main features, which will be expanded to in future releases:

* Optionally display links in tweets for #hashtags and @names
* Option for a custom twitter icon to be displayed with the tweet

== Installation ==

1. Upload `statustag.php` & `statustag_icon.png` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (this happens automatically if you download it through your built-in plugin page)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. This will replace `<?php bloginfo('description'); ?>` with your latest twitter post.
